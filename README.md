This repository is about books that talk about fundamentals for digital design. It includes both the electronics and mathematics involved.

Some of the content here overlaps with [chronomatica](https://github.com/rgantonio/chronomatica) and [digi-forge](https://github.com/rgantonio/digiforge).

I separated a repository for this as it is meant to be a note dump. There are several relevant references linked to this as well.

These notes are literally just mind notes and may not have the complete tutorial. Most of the content are just bullet point notes and solutions to questions.
