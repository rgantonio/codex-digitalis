# :crystal_ball: :stars: codex-digitalis :stars: :crystal_ball:

This repository is about books that talk about fundamentals for digital design. It includes both the electronics and mathematics involved.

Some of the content here overlaps with [chronomatica](https://github.com/rgantonio/chronomatica) and [digi-forge](https://github.com/rgantonio/digiforge).

I separated a repository for this as it is meant to be a note dump. There are several relevant references linked to this as well.
